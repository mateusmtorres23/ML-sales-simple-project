# 🍦 Ice Cream Sales Prediction — Azure Machine Learning

This project uses a **Linear Regression** model to predict ice cream sales based on temperature data.
It was my first hands-on experience with **scikit-learn** and **Azure Machine Learning**, where I trained, tested, and deployed a regression model through a local notebook.

## 🔍 Project Overview

The goal was to estimate the number of ice cream sales given certain temperature values.
After training the model, it was able to make predictions such as **1444** and **908** sales for different temperature inputs.

The notebook includes:

* Data preprocessing and visualization
* Model training with scikit-learn
* Model evaluation
* Connection to Azure ML for deployment and testing

## 💡 What I Learned

This project taught me several important concepts, including:

* How to build and train a regression model using **scikit-learn**
* How to prepare and register **datasets** for testing in Azure ML
* How to **deploy** a trained model to Azure Machine Learning
* How to **communicate with the deployed model** via endpoints
* Basic use of the **Azure CLI** to manage resources and workflows

## 🧠 Tech Stack

* Python
* scikit-learn
* Azure Machine Learning
* Azure CLI
* Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 Results

The model produced rounded sales predictions close to **1444** and **908**, showing that even a simple regression approach can provide valuable insights.
